 Project Summary: StoryCapsule (HTML Web App)

StoryCapsule is a personal, interactive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose is to leave a collection of bedtime audio stories for your girlfriend while you’re away for two months. The app features a visual grid of story categories (e.g., fun, sad, scary, our story). Each story is locked behind a custom question. When she selects a story:
	1.	She answers a personal or memory-based question.
	2.	If the answer is correct, the audio player appears and she can listen to your pre-recorded voice story.
	3.	After listening, she can mark the story as done.
	4.	The home grid visually tracks which stories are completed.

All audio files will be stored in Firebase Storage, and completion status can be saved in localStorage (no account/login required).

This web app can be built using just:
	•	HTML/CSS for layout and styling
	•	JavaScript for interactivity and logic
	•	Firebase for hosting audio files

It’s a sentimental and creative way to stay connected through storytelling and shared memories.
